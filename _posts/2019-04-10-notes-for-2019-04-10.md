## Qt's `macdeployqt` &amp; debug binaries

In some form I have been working with Qt since 2014. A couple years ago I took over as lead on a Qt project and noticed something weird. I could never get breakpoints to work on macOS. After spending a day or two on the problem with no luck, I moved on to more important things, falling back on log messages.

Today I was in another project and looking at `macdeployqt`'s help and I noticed this:

```
-no-strip	Don't run 'strip' on the binaries
```

Even though the Qt project had long been given to another team, I pulled the latest code from the repo and built it. I confirmed that breakpoints still didn't work and then added the `-no-strip` option. Voila! Breakpoints worked!

It seems like bad design that **by default** a tool would remove functionality from a binary when its job is to package that binary. I also wonder does the counterpart, `windeployqt` do something similar?
