Like most developers, I have several ideas I'm juggling at any given time. 

## Main Projects

### Owl

Owl has been a side project since 2012 and I still cannot let go of the idea. 

### arcc

I have a weakspot for command line tools. A couple years ago I went looking for a command line tool that would allow me to use Reddit. Every tool I found was some Javascript, Python or some other scripting language that I couldn't get to work, or it was difficult to get to work. Applications should not be that difficult. 

This was near the Christmas break so I set out to write a Reddit client for the command line in C++. Something that users could download, install and run. 

### oeddit

## Other Projects

### bbcpp

### TuroChamp

### DateTimeGrammars
