These are a few things I learned today .

## `std::ref`

In one portion of our code, we use `std::async` to launch multiple work threads to talk to remote devices and gather results. I had to enhance this functionality so that total number of results does not exceed more than a parameterized number, or a *max*. 

To do this I use an `std::atomic_uint64_t` and pass it and the threaded functionoid into `std::async`. However, for reasons explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18359864/passing-arguments-to-stdasync-by-reference-fails), `std::async` makes copies of all its arguments, but `std::atomic_uint64_t` is not copy-constructible (nor it would make no sense to pass in a copy). Therefore I use `std::ref` which generates a `std::reference_wrapper<T>` that essentially is a reference wrapper which I can pass into the function.

## Ignore whitespace in Github diff views

When viewing diffs in Github, you can have the view ignore whitespaces by adding `?w=1` to the URL.
